Usage:

Import the DNACrusher module and pyplot

    >>>import DNACusher

    >>>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

easy peasyImport your data from a Fasta File

Make a file object from your fasta file

    >>>sequence=open(‘Fasta_File.txt’,'r’)

ta-da!

Convert Your File Object to A String

    >>>sequence=DNACrusher.fasta_to_string(sequence)

now sequence is a string, which is way easier to deal with

Reverse Complement

    >>>sequence=DNACrusher.reverse(sequence)

    >>>sequence=DNACrusher.complement(sequence)

‘atgcaata’->’tattgcat’

Overlap N Base Pairs

    >>>DNACrusher.crush(forward,reverse,N_BasePairs)

This will return the count of matched bps and the longest run of pbs in a tuple (count, longest)

Overlap Up to N Base Pairs

    >>>align=DNACrusher.allign(forward,reverse,N_BasePairs)

This will return a list of tuples [ (pairs_overlapped,(count,longest) , ...]

Now to Plot It

    >>>plt.plot([ x[1][0] for x in align])  #plot the number of agreement

    >>>plt.plot(x[1][1] for x in align]) #plot the record # of runs

    >>>plt.show() #show the graph!
